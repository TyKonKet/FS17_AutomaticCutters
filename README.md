# FS17_AutomaticCutters
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TyKonKet/FS17_AutomaticCutters.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TyKonKet/FS17_AutomaticCutters)  
Makes the lowering and rising of combines-cutter automatic. This will avoid ugly turns at the end of the field. You can also choose on every single cutter to use or not this feature. This is not properly a realistic feature, but if you also like to play "arcade mode" maybe this mod is right for you.
